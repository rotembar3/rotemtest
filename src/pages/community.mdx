# Swimm Developer Community

As a language-agnostic tool, our community of users spans many different 
countries and many different disciplines within software engineering. 
What we all have in common is, our desire to share knowledge and learn.

We respectfully ask that everyone follow our Code Of Conduct when
engaging with others in the Swimm community, this includes Swimm employees
and associates.

## Our Primary Community Hub Is Slack

Please join our community channel for asking questions, getting to know our developers, 
sharing funny gifs and talking about documentation & writing in general. It's pretty 
low-volume and relaxed.
