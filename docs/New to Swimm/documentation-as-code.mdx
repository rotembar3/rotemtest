DaC (Documentation as Code) is an approach of treating documentation like code so that documentation and code are created and maintained together. 

**Docs-as-code principles include the following:**
- Docs are part of the Version Control (Git)
- The underlying syntax is Markdown
- Docs can be the subject of code reviews, automated tests, and the CI process

The Docs-as-code approach gives developers the benefits of a more streamlined process. This includes the ability to write and edit documents as part of the development process; documents are committed as Markdown files alongside the code; documents are naturally versioned within branches; documentation is enforced as part of PR or CI processes; documentation is available in the IDE.

## Docs-as-code & Swimm 
Swimm saves all documentation as code, which means that Swimm Docs are as easy to read as Markdown files. 


A simple and typical editing workflow looks like this:
1. Closer to the end of a development task, the developer commits their changes.
2. Swimm detects that as a result of code changes, some documents need to be amended and notifies the developer. 
3. The developer then accesses these docs and either automatically approves Swimm’s Auto-sync corrections, or decides to further edit the doc.
4. Once done, developers commit the changes as part of the PR.
